## What I'm working on lately

- Replacing my personal bash scripts with TypeScript [Deno scripts](https://deno.com/)
   - Had fun writing a [script to parse MP4 file headers](https://gist.github.com/NSExceptional/17e38f3b0818f5330bbc9ee444157768) to check whether a video has the `hvc1` tag
- Wrote a VS Code extension to wrap our<sup><sup>Tinder's</sup></sup> CLI build tools in a GUI
- Wrote some userscripts to automate common tasks when creating or reveiwing PRs at work ([gist](https://gist.github.com/tinder-tannerbennett/7ab2091184dbad71f5387cca3960e65f))
   - My favorite is the one that generates a message like this with a keystroke, for pasting into Slack:
     ```
     [My small PR](url) `+4 -19` @required-reviewer-1 @required-reviewer-2
     ```
- Writing [jailbreak tweaks for my Mac](https://gist.github.com/NSExceptional/45faffa17b26e3064b66aa6a07b32abe) to fix some minor annoyances with macOS
   - Yes, you can write macOS tweaks!
